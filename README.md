Activity Steps:
Install node. https://nodejs.org/en/
Create a folder named node-activity and create an app.js file inside it.
Import the http module using require(). Save the module as a const variable called http.

Hint: You can import a module into your file using the following syntax:
const moduleName = require('moduleName');

Create a simple server using the .createServer() method and assign it to a const variable called server.
Using the server object, make your newly created server listen on port 4001.
Inside the callback function of the .createServer() method, have the server return a response of 'Hello World' using the .end() method.
Create a github repository and upload. Send the link to discord.
